Reward function for BR-1 locomotion.

Reward terms are computed from PRIVILEGED, noiseless simulation state (base
linear velocity included) -- that is standard and correct: the reward
function is a training-time-only oracle, unlike the observation the policy
actually sees (env/observations.py), which must stay realistic.

R = w_vel * lin_vel_track + w_ang * ang_vel_track + w_up * upright
  + w_h * height + w_alive * alive
  - w_tau * torque - w_ar * action_rate - w_ja * joint_acc
  - w_slip * foot_slip - w_col * collision
  - fall_penalty * (1 if terminated by falling else 0)

REWARD-HACKING GUARDS (Part 10) -- what each penalty is there to stop:
  torque, action_rate, joint_acc  -> jittery, high-frequency, energy-wasting
                                      policies; also discourages "vibrating
                                      in place" to farm the alive bonus.
  foot_slip                        -> sliding feet instead of stepping
                                      (only meaningful once stepping starts,
                                      M5+; harmless at M4 with cmd=0).
  collision (non-foot ground hit)  -> "walking" by dragging a knee/torso,
                                      or falling forward while still racking
                                      up alive/velocity reward before the
                                      termination check fires.
  height term                      -> discourages crouching low to farm a
                                      cheap upright/stability score, or
                                      jumping (a height term alone doesn't
                                      stop jumping -- action_rate/torque and
                                      the foot-contact-based alive/height
                                      combination discourage the aerial
                                      phase a jump requires).
  tracking (not raw speed) reward  -> rewarding raw forward SPEED (instead
                                      of tracking a commanded speed) lets the
                                      policy farm reward by falling forward
                                      with increasing velocity; tracking a
                                      *bounded* command with a Gaussian
                                      kernel caps the achievable reward at
                                      "moving exactly at the requested
                                      speed", removing that incentive.

NORMALIZATION (added after EXP-001, revised after EXP-001b/c):
EXP-001's torque penalty was raw sum(tau^2) in Nm^2, unbounded up to
~172,800 across 12 joints -- under an UNTRAINED policy's near-maximal
exploration noise it regularly swamped the well-behaved-state total of
about +3 to +4 (alive + upright + height + tracking), making "end the
episode immediately" locally better than "keep exploring toward standing."
EXP-001's curve showed exactly that signature: reward/ep_len fell for the
first ~450k steps while mean_tilt_deg stayed flat at ~13-16 deg (well under
the 40 deg fall threshold) -- episodes were ending via height collapse
under penalty pressure, not by toppling.

The first fix (bounding torque + an unmeasured guess at a joint_acc scale)
was incomplete: an actual random-action measurement (500 steps, see
scripts/test_env.py-style probe in the Milestone 4 writeup) showed
joint_acc and foot_slip -- NOT torque -- were the real dominant terms,
reaching unweighted means of -22.7 and -11.6 and single-step worsts of
-64.3 and -88.7 respectively, versus torque's worst of only -0.27 once
normalized. Guessing a normalization constant without measuring was the
mistake; every penalty term below is now EXPLICITLY CLIPPED before being
normalized, so each unweighted term is hard-bounded to [-1, 0] no matter
how chaotic the motion gets -- the clip bounds (ACC_CLIP, SLIP_CLIP) are
INITIAL ASSUMPTIONs (generous "this would already be violent" values), not
measured hardware limits; revisit once gait data from a standing policy
exists. With every penalty bounded to [-1,0] and current weights
(sum ~2.15), the worst possible per-step penalty is now ~-2.15, well below
a single alive/upright/height/tracking step's worth (~+3 to +4) -- so
surviving an additional step can no longer be worse than ending the
episode, removing the perverse incentive by construction rather than by
hoping the scale is small enough.
